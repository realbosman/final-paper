    Father Sheedy grew up on a farm in Ireland, the fourth of 12 children. <br> As a boy, he dreamt of running the family farm; however, <br> God had other plans. When his father gave that job to his younger brother,<br> Father Sheedy decided to follow in the footsteps of his three uncles,<br> who were priests, and three aunts, who were religious sisters, and, at the age of 17. <br> 
    On June 13, 1965, Father Sheedy and his brother, Michael, were ordained <br> to the priesthood in Clare County, Ireland –and then soon <br> after Father Sheedy arrived in Florida. The occasion was made even more <br> memorable as it was also the date of their parents’ wedding anniversary. <br>
